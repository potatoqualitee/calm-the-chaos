   ```

2. Host this file anywhere on the web (e.g., GitHub Gist, Pastebin)
3. In the extension settings:
   - Go to the "Import/Export" tab

#### Ideas

- Develop a configurable scale to adjust the sensitivity of the algorithm in identifying containers to hide. This would allow users to fine-tune the content filtering based on their preferences.

## ü§ñ Built with AI

I'm a software architect with limited JavaScript expertise. I built this extension primarily using AI tools - specifically Claude.ai's web interface, the Cline VS Code extension, OpenRouter.ai's reseller API service, and Anthropic's direct API. While I can work with JavaScript when needed, I relied heavily on these AI assistants for development.

One way that I optimized costs was to have a Project in Claude solve the problem, then give the output to Cline to do the implementation. I also learned that when debugging, sometimes the session will get in a loop and make worse and worse code. After spending about $1.50 on a problematic bug, I found much better results by having Cline summarize the problem and potential solution, then starting a new session to implement it.

I ended up using OpenRouter when I ran out of Anthropic tokens (their limit is quite low). The total cost was around $300, but that was mainly because I chose the wrong model on OpenRouter (Anthropic/auto?) that didn't have caching, and I was initially feeding it huge files before the refactor.

And really, it's addictive to add new features when it's so easy and fun to use.
